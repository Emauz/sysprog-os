NIC does not add it's own ethernet frame header it appears
It also does not respond to ARPs / send ARPs itself
the configure internal address sets it's MAC address (which resets to 0xFFFFFFFFFFFF (the broadcast address) every reset)

It seems like the card adds it's own padding (on the receive) up to 60 bytes (discards FCS I think)
At least the padding doesn't show up in Wireshark
