We have two user processes to test our system with accompanything test scripts.

socket_test:
    This process is found in userland/socket_test.c and is included by defining SPAWN_SOCKET_TEST in
    'users.h'. It calls all of the syscalls, sending 10 transmissions total and receiving 1.

    We statically set the IP of a PC connected to the system to 10.10.10.2 and used wireshark to listen
    for the 10 transmissions. The IP addreess, MAC address, and UDP ports should switch between the first
    5 and second 5 transmissions. After transmitting the process waits for a packet to be sent to IP
    10.0.2.15 on port 8081. The script 'test_scripts/sendUDP.py' is a simple script that sends to an
    IP and port.

    This can also be tested using Qemu emulation, the Makefile target 'qemucap' sets up hostforwarding
    and logs all packets to 'traffic.pcap'. When using sendUDP.py, send to 127.0.0.1 on port 8080, that
    will be forwared by Qemu to 10.0.2.15 on port 8081.

TigerTalk:
    TigerTalk is a chat message server implemeneted in userland/ttalk.c and included by defining
    SPAWN_TTALK in 'users.h'. It waits to receive a message on a specific port, prints the
    message out over serial I/O, waits for the user to type a response and hit 'enter', then sends
    that message to whoever sent the original message.

    The client side of TigerTalk is the script 'test_scripts/ttalk.py'. Run this script with IP
    10.0.2.15 on port 8081 to talk to the system. If using qemu, use IP 127.0.0.1 and port 8080.
