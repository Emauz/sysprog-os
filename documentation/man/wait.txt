NAME
        wait - wait for a child process to terminate

SYNOPSIS
        #include "common.h"
        #include "ulib.h"

        int32_t wait( int32_t *status );

DESCRIPTION
        wait() causes the current process to wait until a child process 
        terminates. 'status' is a pointer to a int32_t into which the 
        child's status is placed, or NULL. If there are no children in 
        the system, returns an error code (*status is unchanged). 
        If there are one or more children in the system and at least one 
        has terminated but hasn't yet been cleaned up, cleans up that 
        process and returns its information; otherwise, blocks 
        until a child terminates.

RETURN VALUE
        The PID of the terminated child, or an error code
