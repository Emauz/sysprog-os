NAME
        msg - Network Message

SYNOPSIS
        #include "net.h"

DESCRIPTION
        The msg_t structure describes an Ethernet/IPv4/UDP network
        message needed by the netsend and netrecv system calls.

        typedef struct {
            uint16_t src_port; 
            uint16_t dst_port;
            uint32_t src_addr;
            uint32_t dst_addr;
            uint64_t dst_MAC;
            uint64_t src_MAC;
            uint16_t len;
            uint8_t* data; // data buffer to read/write from
        } msg_t;

        src_port and dst_port refer to 16-bit network order UDP
        ports. See hton16 to convert to network order.

        src_addr and dst_addr are 32-bit network order IPv4 
        addresses. See htons to convert to network order.

        dst_MAC and src_MAC are 48-bit network order MAC addresses.
        The high 16 bits should always be zero.

        data is a pointer to user memory of len many bytes.
