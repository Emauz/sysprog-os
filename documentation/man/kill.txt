NAME
        kill - terminate a process with extreme prejudice

SYNOPSIS
        #include "common.h"
        #include "ulib.h"

        int32_t kill( pid_t pid );

DESCRIPTION
        Terminates a process with id 'pid'. If terminating the current 
        process, 0 should be passed in as 'pid'. On successful
        termination, kill() returns 0. If an error occurs, an integer less
        than 0 will be returned. If terminating the current process, 
        nothing is returned.

RETURN VALUE
        0 on success, else < 0 on an error, unless pid was 0.
