DESCRIPTION
        netsend() attempts to send a message described by 'msg' over
        ethernet.

        msg should have src_port, dst_port, dst_addr, dst_MAC, len,
        and data set. len bytes from data will be sent from src_port 
        to dst_port at dst_addr at dst_MAC. src_MAC and src_addr will
        be ignored and filled in with the systems currently set IP
        and MAC addresses.

        All messages will be sent as Ethernet/UDP/IPv4 packets. 

RETURN VALUE
        On a successful send, E_SUCCESS will be returned. On failure
        E_FAILURE will be returned.
