NAME
        netrecv - receive a message over ethernet

SYNOPSIS
        #include "common.h"
        #include "net.h"
        #include "ulib.h"

        int32_t netrecv(msg_t* msg);

DESCRIPTION
        netrecv() attempts to receive a message described by 'msg' 
        over ethernet.

        msg should have dst_port, len, and data set. When a packet
        addressed to the system is received with a destination port
        of dst_port, at most len bytes of the payload will be copied
        to data. If more than len bytes are receive, len will be
        updated to reflect the actual number of bytes received. All
        other members of msg will be filled in on return.

        Valid messages to receive are Ethernet/UDP/IPv4 messages.

RETURN VALUE
        On a successful receive, E_SUCCESS will be returned. 
        On failure E_FAILURE will be returned.
